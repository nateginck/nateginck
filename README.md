# Welcome to my Github Profile!

Hello! I'm Nate Ginck, a computer engineering student at Pitt with a passion for Artificial Intelligence. On this page, you can find some projects I have completed in machine learning, image processing, and statistical modeling. 

Here are some of my favorites:

- **[Myoelectric Prosthetic Hand](https://github.com/nateginck/Myoelectric-Prosthetic)**: For my Senior Design Capstone Project, we designed a prosthetic hand that uses sEMG signals from wet electrodes to make live gesture predictions. We achieved around 80% accuracy to classify three different hand states: open, partially open, and closed.
- **[Predicting Song Popularity With Machine Learning](https://github.com/nateginck/Predicting-Song-Popularity-With-Machine-Learning)**: For this project, I performed mean normalization, feature selection, and cross-validation to determine an optimal model for determining song popularity. Spoiler Alert: the Bagged Tree Model performed the best.
- **[Neural Network Implementation](https://github.com/nateginck/Neural-Network-Implementation)**: Here, I wrote code for a neural network involving backpropagation and an activation function. This is a great way to learn the basics of how neural networks work for beginners to machine learning!
- **[PCA, SVM, and KNN Implementation](https://github.com/nateginck/PCA-SVM-and-KNN-Implementation)**: This project entails using Principal Component Analysis, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithms. Basically, these are some fundamentals in the realm of machine learning.
